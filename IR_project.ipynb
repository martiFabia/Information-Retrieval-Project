By applying Variable-Byte Encoding (VBEncode), each integer is represented using the minimal number of bytes necessary, achieving a highly compact and performant encoding scheme.\n","\n","This design offers major logistical benefits:\n","\n","- It is compact, consuming minimal disk space.\n","- It is portable, making it easy to copy, transfer, or deploy to new environments.\n","\n","#### Key features\n","Our compression pipeline is a two-stage process designed for both simplicity and efficiency:\n","\n","1. **Gap Encoding:** First, the sorted list of docIDs for a term is converted into gaps (the differences between consecutive IDs). This transforms a list of large, increasing numbers into a list of mostly small integers.\n","2. **Variable-Byte (VB) Encoding:** Second, this VB encoding is applied to compress the small integer gaps.\n","\n","A crucial part of our strategy is to also compress the term frequencies (TFs) using the same VB encoding. This choice provides two major advantages:\n","\n","1. **Space Optimization:** Due to Zipf's Law, the vast majority of TFs are very small integers (overwhelmingly 1, 2, or 3). Storing them as fixed-width 16 or 32-bit integers would be extremely wasteful. VB encoding is perfectly suited for this data, compressing most TFs into a single byte.\n","\n","2. **Decoder Efficiency:** Compressing both allows us to create a uniform, interleaved data stream ([gap1, tf1, gap2, tf2, ...]). This design is highly efficient:\n","\n","    - **Simple Code:** We only need a single, simple VB decoder that reads both values simultaneously in a tight loop.\n","    - **CPU Cache Locality:** This stream design significantly boosts decompression speed. A gap and its corresponding TF are physically adjacent,  meaning the CPU finds both pieces of data in its cache, avoiding a slower lookup to another memory location."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"E_XIFMtHGO5v"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Variable-Byte encode/decode\n","def VBEncode(n):\n","    \"\"\"Encode a single non-negative integer into VB code (list of bytes).\"\"\"\n","    if n < 0:\n","        raise ValueError(\"VBEncode expects non-negative integers\")\n","    byte = []\n","    while True:\n","        byte.append(n % 128)  # 7 LSB kept, MSB=0 for continuation\n","        if n < 128:\n","            break\n","        n //= 128\n","    byte[0] += 128  # set MSB=1 on the last byte (end marker)\n","    return byte[::-1]\n","\n","def VBEncodeList(n_list):\n","    \"\"\"Encode a list of non-negative integers with VB code (concatenated).\"\"\"\n","    out = []\n","    for n in n_list:\n","        out.extend(VBEncode(n))\n","    return out\n","\n","def VBDecode(stream):\n","    \"\"\"Decode a VB-encoded byte stream back to list of integers (utility/testing).\"\"\"\n","    n_list, n = [], 0\n","    for b in stream:\n","        if b >= 128:          # MSB=1 → this is the last byte of current integer\n","            n = 128 * n + (b - 128)\n","            n_list.append(n)\n","            n = 0\n","        else:                 # MSB=0 → continuation\n","            n = 128 * n + b\n","    return n_list\n","\n","# Gap encoding helpers\n","\n","def to_gaps(n_list):\n","    if len(n_list) == 0:\n","        return []\n","    return [n_list[0]] + list(np.diff(n_list))\n","\n","def from_gaps(gaps):\n","    return list(np.cumsum(gaps))\n","\n","# Posting list\n","\n","def encode_postings(postings):\n","    \"\"\"\n","    Encode a posting list using:\n","      - gap encoding on docIDs\n","      - variable-byte encoding on all integers\n","    Input:\n","        postings: list of tuples (docid, tf)\n","                  e.g. [(2, 3), (10, 1), (25, 2)]\n","    Output:\n","        bytes: compressed byte sequence\n","    \"\"\"\n","    if not postings:\n","        return b''\n","\n","    # Split docids and term frequencies\n","    docids, freqs = zip(*postings)\n","\n","    # Apply gap encoding\n","    gaps = to_gaps(docids)\n","\n","    # Use bytearray for efficient accumulation\n","    out = bytearray()\n","    append = out.extend  # local alias for efficiency\n","\n","    for g, tf in zip(gaps, freqs):\n","        append(VBEncode(g))\n","        append(VBEncode(tf))\n","\n","    return bytes(out)\n","\n","\n","def decode_postings(encoded_bytes):\n","    \"\"\"\n","    Decode a posting list encoded with encode_postings().\n","    Input:\n","        encoded_bytes: bytes or bytearray\n","    Output:\n","        docids: array('I') of document IDs (uint32)\n","        freqs: array('H') or array('I') of term frequencies\n","    \"\"\"\n","    if not encoded_bytes:\n","        return array('I'), array('I')\n","\n","    # Decode variable-byte encoded integers\n","    data = VBDecode(list(encoded_bytes))\n","\n","    # Separate docid gaps and term frequencies\n","    gaps = data[::2]\n","    tfs  = data[1::2]\n","    docids = from_gaps(gaps)\n","\n","    ds = array('I', docids)     # uint32 for docids\n","    # Determine appropriate type for term frequencies\n","    max_tf = max(tfs) if tfs else 0\n","    tf_code = 'H' if max_tf <= 65535 else 'I'\n","    fs = array(tf_code, tfs)\n","\n","    return ds, fs\n","\n","\n","#Compression\n","@profile\n","def compress_inverted_index(inv):\n","    \"\"\"\n","    inv: {'docids': {termid: [d1,...]}, 'freqs': {termid: [tf1,...]}}\n","    -> {termid: encoded_bytes}\n","    \"\"\"\n","    comp = {}\n","    inv_d, inv_f = inv['docids'], inv['freqs']\n","    enc = encode_postings  # local alias\n","\n","    for termid in inv_d:\n","        ds = inv_d[termid]\n","        fs = inv_f[termid]\n","        comp[termid] = enc(zip(ds, fs))\n","    return comp\n","\n","@profile\n","def decompress_inverted_index_arrays(compressed_inv):\n","    inv_d, inv_f = {}, {}\n","    for termid, blob in compressed_inv.items():\n","        ds, fs = decode_postings(blob)\n","        inv_d[termid] = ds\n","        inv_f[termid] = fs\n","    return {'docids': inv_d, 'freqs': inv_f}\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"EY5TTHRrq3oR"},"source":["### Saving or loading indexes"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"wFshm3OVNrdm"},"source":["Given the computational cost of processing the MS MARCO dataset and the memory constraints of the Colab environment, rebuilding the index at every execution is inefficient.\n","\n","To address this, we execute the build_index function only once.

While standard DAAT exhaustively calculates scores for every document containing query terms, this implementation introduces **dynamic pruning** to skip expensive scoring operations for documents that have no mathematical chance of making the top-$k$ cut.\n","\n","#### Algorithmic Strategy and Motivations\n","\n","#### 1. Heuristic Term Reordering\n","**Code:** `postings.sort(key=lambda p: getattr(p, \"max_score\", 0.0), reverse=True)`\n","**Motivation:** The algorithm begins by sorting the query terms based on their maximum possible score contribution (upper bound) in descending order.\n","* **Critical Reasoning:** By processing the most \"significant\" terms first (e.g., rare terms with high IDF), the document accumulates score mass rapidly. This allows the pruning condition to be evaluated earlier in the loop, maximizing the probability of skipping operations for the remaining, less significant terms.\n","\n","#### 2. Pre-computed Upper Bound Suffixes\n","**Code:** `suffix_ub` calculation.\n","**Motivation:** An array of suffix sums is constructed where `suffix_ub[i]` represents the sum of the maximum scores of all terms from index $i$ to the end of the list.\n","* **Critical Reasoning:** This provides an $O(1)$ lookup to answer the question: *\"If the current document contained every single remaining query term and achieved the maximum possible score for them, what is the theoretical maximum score it could achieve?\"* This is the mathematical foundation required for safe pruning.\n","\n","#### 3. Dynamic \"Light\" Pruning\n","**Code:** `if not skip_rest and score + suffix_ub[i] <= theta: skip_rest = True`\n","**Motivation:** Inside the document processing loop, the algorithm checks the pruning condition against $\\theta$ (the lowest score currently in the top-$k$ queue).\n","* **The Logic:** If the current accumulated `score` plus the maximum potential future score (`suffix_ub[i]`) is less than or equal to $\\theta$, the document is **doomed**.

This approach becomes computationally expensive when queries contain frequent, non-discriminative terms (low IDF) which possess extremely long posting lists. A significant amount of memory and CPU cycles are wasted initializing and updating accumulators for documents that contain only these common terms. These documents inevitably end up with low scores and have a negligible probability of making it into the final top-$k$ ranking, effectively acting as \"noise\" during processing."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### TAAT improvement\n","\n","**Optimization Strategy: Static Pruning with Safety Guard**\n","\n","To address the inefficiency of standard TAAT on large collections like MS MARCO, we implemented an IDF-Sorted TAAT with Accumulator Pruning. This strategy optimizes the trade-off between retrieval speed and effectiveness through two key mechanisms:\n","\n","\n","1.   ***IDF Sorting & Safety Guard:*** Query terms are processed in descending order of IDF (rarest first). A \"Safety Guard\" ensures that the most discriminative term is always processed fully, populating the accumulator with all potential candidates regardless of memory limits. This guarantees high recall for the query's core concept.\n","2.   ***Accumulator Pruning:*** For subsequent, lower-IDF terms, we enforce a strict limit on the accumulator size (e.g., *max_accumulators=5000*). Once this limit is reached, the algorithm switches to a refinement-only mode, where scores are updated only for documents already present in the accumulator.\n","\n","\n","**Benefits:** This approach drastically reduces the computational cost of processing common, low-information terms (long posting lists) by avoiding millions of unnecessary dictionary insertions.

This empirically confirms that the improved efficiency was achieved without any degradation in retrieval effectiveness."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":149},"id":"JW2uxnpENrdt","outputId":"ead22076-4c4e-423b-9cf9-071e14604747"},"outputs":[{"data":{"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"summary":"{\n

To ensure validity, we must apply the Bonferroni correction. This is necessary because when performing multiple tests, the probability of committing a Type I error (rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true) increases according to the formula:$$P = 1 - (1 - \\alpha)^k$$Where $\\alpha$ is the significance level and $k$ is the number of tests performed (in our case, $\\alpha = 0.05$ and $k = 6$). Consequently, the probability of committing a Type I error in our scenario is:$$ P = 1 - ( 1- 0.05)^6 = 0.2649 = 26.49\\%$$Specifically, the Bonferroni correction adjusts the significance threshold $\\alpha$ as follows:$$\\alpha_{Bonf} = 1 - (1 - \\alpha)^\\frac{1}{k} \\approx \\frac{\\alpha}{k}$$In our specific case, we obtain:$$\\alpha_{Bonf} = \\frac{0.05}{6} \\approx 0.0083$$Naturally, a test performed with the Bonferroni correction is significantly more stringent and may increase the risk of Type II errors (failing to reject the null hypothesis when it is actually false). However, in this context, we prefer to maintain a stricter test to avoid potential Type I errors, although less stringent corrections could alternatively be applied.\n","The conducted tests are divided into two categories:\n","1) Comparison between Baseline TAAT and Improved TAAT\n","    - Improved TAAT vs. Baseline TAAT: We hypothesize that the Baseline TAAT has worse efficiency, resulting in longer query execution times ($H_1 : Time_{base} > Time_{imp}$).\n","2) Comparison among Improved TAAT versions\n","    - TAAT 2k vs. TAAT 5k (and TAAT 10k): We hypothesize that the TAAT 2k is more

Consequently, we proposed specific refinements to the QE process to mitigate its primary drawback: **Topic Drift**.\n","\n","Topic drift occurs when expansion terms shift the semantic focus of the query away from the user's original intent, leading to the retrieval of documents that are relevant to the expanded query but irrelevant to the original one. To address this issue, we implemented three main improvements:\n","\n"," 1. **Rank-Biased Term Weighting:**\n","When selecting terms for the expanded query, greater weight is assigned to terms appearing in top-ranked documents from the initial retrieval. Specifically, a decay factor is applied based on the document's rank:\n","\n","$$\n","decay = \\frac{1}{1 + document\\_rank}\n","$$\n","\n","For instance, the top-ranked document (rank 0) retains a decay factor of 1.0 (no penalty), while the second document (rank 1) has its term weights scaled by a factor of 0.5.\n","\n"," 2. **Minimum Quality Threshold (QPP Filter):**\n","Extracting useful expansion terms is difficult when the initial retrieval yields poor results (i.e., when even the top-ranked document has a very low score). Proceeding with QE in such cases significantly increases the risk of topic drift. Therefore, we established a minimum quality threshold of **12** for the top document's score. If the top score falls below this threshold, the Query Expansion process is skipped entirely.\n","\n"," 3. **Dynamic $\\alpha$ Weighting (Boosting & Damping):**\n","Consistent with the logic above, the reliance on the expanded terms (controlled by the parameter $\\alpha$) is adjusted dynamically based on the confidence in the initial retrieval. If the top document has a high score, we place more trust in the expansion; if the score is low, we rely on it less.\n","\n","While the default parameter is $\\alpha = 0.3$, we modified it based on the following heuristic thresholds:\n","\n","* $Top\\ score > 35 \\rightarrow \\alpha = 0.4$ (**Boost**)\n","* $18 < Top\\ score \\leq 35 \\rightarrow \\alpha = 0.3$ (**Standard**)\n","* $12 < Top\\ score \\leq 18 \\rightarrow \\alpha = 0.15$ (**Damping**)\n","\n","*Note: All thresholds were determined heuristically.*"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"2Hp5VGKvDvLv"},"outputs":[],"source":["def select_expansion_terms(query,\n","                           top_docs,\n","                           index,\n","                           dir_index_topk,\n","                           id2term,\n","                           fb_docs=10,\n","                           fb_terms=3,\n","                           in_memory=False):\n","    \"\"\"\n","    Selects expansion terms using the top-k direct index.\n","\n","    Parameters:\n","      -

The results validate the quality of our systems on effectiveness.\n","\n","* **Validation of Custom Implementation:**\n","    Our optimized pruning model (`BM25_TAAT_2K`) outperforms the standard `BM25_PYTERRIER` baseline across almost all metrics (nDCG@10: **0.4979** vs 0.4806). This confirms that our Python-based TAAT implementation with *Beneficial Pruning* is highly effective, filtering out noise that slightly penalizes the standard unpruned Terrier index.\n","\n","* **Superiority of Robust QE (V2):**\n","    The `BM25_TAAT_10K_QE_V2` model demonstrates a massive improvement in coverage compared to the standard PyTerrier baseline:\n","    * **Recall@1000:** Jumps from 0.7326 (PyTerrier) to 0.7853.\n","    * **Precision:** the model with query expansion also beats the PyTerrier baseline on precision metrics (**nDCG@10: 0.4891** vs 0.4806 and **MAP: 0.3011** vs 0.2817).\n","\n","From a purely effectiveness-oriented perspective, the evaluation clearly favors the model with query expansion, which maximizes some metrics. However, when incorporating efficiency into the analysis, the unexpanded TAAT model without QE offers the superior trade-off between response time and retrieval quality.\n","\n","The choice of the optimal model depends heavily on the specific application requirements. If low latency is not a critical constraint, the Query Expansion model is probably the best choice for maximizing information retrieval.\n","On the other hand, for applications prioritizing a balance between efficiency and effectiveness—particularly those where the user is only interested in the top-ranked results—the unexpanded TAAT model represents the optimal solution.\n","\n","Crucially, the comparison with the baseline reveals a significant achievement: all our custom implementations demonstrate effectiveness that is fully aligned with the standard **PyTerrier** model, often achieving numerically higher metric scores.
